Statistics for data science - Operations on distributions, Hypothesis testing, Estimation, Correlation
Sub topics that are covered 
===========================

1 - Find out the skewness of a distribution ( add Pearson's median skewness coefficient). 
2 - Write a class to generate exponential distribution (check if any parameters can be tweaked).
3 - Calculate PDF of an exponential distribution. Check if it can be derived from CDF.
4 - Different ways to measure the results of hyposthesis testing.
	4a - Classical
	4b - Practical
	4c - Bayesian 
5 - Example of Chi Squared test.
6 - How are MSE and MLE different in helping find the best estimator?
7 - How can Bayesian estimation be used to calculate confidence intervals?
8 - Define the statistical significance of correlation and two ways of calculating it.
9 - Compare Pearson’s correlation with Spearman’s rank correlation.
10 - Explain how Least Squares Fit can be used to calculate the slope of a relationship.
11 - Demonstrate the interpretation of a sample R-squared value to determine goodness of fit.
